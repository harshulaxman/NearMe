            Porur is known for the expansive lake of the same name and the small, waterside Porur Lake Shiva Temple.
             Nearby, the centuries-old Sri Ramanaadheswarar Temple has an ornately carved gopura gateway tower. Clothing and appliances stores, Indian restaurants, 
            and the N.S.N. produce and fish markets cluster at the busy junction of Kundrathur Main Road and Mount Poonamalle High Road.
